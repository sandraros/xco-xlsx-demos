# xco-xlsx-demos
Simple demos for reading and writing to XLSX via XCO

The program `Z_XCO_XLSX_DEMO_WRITE` reads any number of lines from any table and downloads to an Excel file.

The program `Z_XCO_XLSX_DEMO_READ` is the reverse logic of the WRITE program: it reads an Excel file which contains data of any database table into an internal table, and displays it.

These programs have been tested on ABAP 7.58.
